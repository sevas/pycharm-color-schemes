# What is this ?

A bunch of color schemes for the [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) python IDE. 
These schemes were not created by me, I merely ported them, because I wasn't happy with 
what I found online.

Here is the current list.

# Installation

The XML files should be copied to the following directory:

* MacOS X: `~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm10/colors/` 
* GNU/Linux: `~/.PyCharm10/config/color`
* Windows Vista and 7: `C:\Users\$USER\.PyCharm10\config\colors`
* Windows XP: `C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\.PyCharm10\config\colors`


You might need to change the font. I recommend Menlo on OSX, Consolas on Windows and whatever default monospace font you can find on your linux box.

I would stay away from Courier New.
